How to run this shit :metal::
1. Clone this repo
2. Download code::blocks **17.12** with **mingw32**. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/)
3. Open read-inventory/read-inventory.cbp and compile it
4. ```npm install```
5. ```cd app && npm install```
6. ```cd ..```
7. And now you must do 2 things at the same time, so open 2 terminals or something!
    * ```npm run serve```
    * ```npm start```
